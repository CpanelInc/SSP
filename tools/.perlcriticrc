# https://github.com/Perl-Critic/Perl-Critic/issues/670
# Ignore the complaint because we're just disabling the modules anyway.

[-Subroutines::ProhibitCallsToUndeclaredSubs]
# SSP makes efforts to include and use some modules that may or may not exist on a system, so they don't get imported in the usual way
